# BatchImageConverter

### Batch Image Converter
* A tool to batch convert common image formats to baseline JPG, progressive JPG, or PNG
* This was originally just intended to be used with the Wii's Photo Channel, but I've expanded it a bit

### Setup to get this tool working
* Have an image in one of the following formats
  * PNG
  * JPG
  * JPEG
  * BMP
  * WEBP
  * HEIC
  * HEIF
* Choose the folder containing your images (subfolders aren't checked)
* Choose the output format (Baseline/Progressive JPG, PNG)
* Choose an output directory for the converted images
* Hope this tool is useful for batch converting images!

### Wii Photo Channel Notes

### Note on Large Images
* Images larger than 8192x8192 are not supported by the Photo Channel
* There is an option to keep images larger from the conversion process

### If Using Dolphin Emulator
* Keep your Virtual SD Card 512 MB or under
* I've had issues with baseline JPGs not loading despite it being supported
